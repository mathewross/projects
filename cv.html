		<h4>Design</h4><br/>- Current modules in my second year include redesigning the Nutribullet blender, creating a floor cleaning
device for the elderly and designing a product to help remind Psoriasis patients to take medication.<br/>
- Experience in Creo Parametric modelling a Honda GX160 engine with working assembled parts.<br/>
- 3D Modelled a phone case which was later manufactured on a laser cutter on my internship.<br/>
- Taught myself Autodesk Fusion 360 and Keyshot during the summer and 3D printed various small objects.<br/>
- Able to practice 2D technical and 3D perspective drawing in Design Communication and Design B project.<br/><br/>
		<h4>Working Independently</h4><br/>- During my internship, making the thermodynamic laboratory scripts heightened my attention to detail,
making decisions independently and working alone.<br/>
- I reinforced working alone whilst data collecting using Survey Monkey to create excel spreadsheets and
graphs. This data was then followed up by meetings with senior members of staff to analyse data found.<br/><br/>
		<h4>Team Work</h4><br/>- In Design A, I was part of a team of 5 to design and develop the slot car that was raced against other teams.<br/>
		- During my Internship, I worked alongside other engineers from different fields to create the phone case for
an Outreach project and worked with others to interpret data research to create graphs.<br/><br/>
- Working in the hospitality sector made me realise this importance in a hot and busy environment.
		<h4>Time Management</h4><br/>- Being employed whilst in education has given me good time management skills and the ability to prioritise.<br/>
		- Working on data collection during my internship meant that I had to work to tight deadlines.<br/>
		- Working in the hospitality industry gave me the opportunity to supervise 30 members of staff, serve food at
Chester Racecourse and this helped reinforce my communication and management skills to staff.<br/><br/>
		<h4>Communication</h4><br/>- Improved this whilst reviewing the thermodynamics lab scripts and liaising with senior members of staff.<br/>
		- Communicated both on a shop floor and on the phone whilst working in retail and university open days.<br/><br/>
		
		</div>
		<div class="hobbies">
		<br/><h2 class="hobbiesHeader">Hobbies & Interests</h2>
		- Running, completed Liverpool half marathon and Spring 10k<br/>
		- Visiting design museums such as copenhagen, london and oslo<br/>
		- Keeping  up to date with latest tech, including experimenting with Arduino boards<br/>
		- Participated in ACT Cadets, which allowed me to experience flying an aircraft, shooting, cross country and completing the DofE Bronze Award<br/>
		- Slacklining<br/>
		- Cycling<br/><br/>
